\chapter{Introduction}
Contrasting with ERGM where edges can only be binary (exist or not exist), the valued networks enable the extension of edges definition. The idea is to model network that edges can be any value of count, measurement, or rank \citep{countergmdefined}. However, the paper only discuss ergm extension to count values where it can take on any positive integer value.
